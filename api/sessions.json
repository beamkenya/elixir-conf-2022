This talk will cover advancing the usage and design patterns of the language for Android development to solve larger problems. While the content is targeted at mobile development, there will be value for all Java developers interested in Kotlin.\r\nPrior knowledge or use of Kotlin is not required to attend this talk. Some concepts of the language will be used without introduction but they are intuitive and/or quickly learned. Even if you donâ€™t fully understand every language concept on which each example is built, the resulting functionality will be clear.\r\n\r\nSections\r\n- Signs on Kotlin Street(What is Kotlin all about?)\r\n- Why we need Kotlin\r\n- Examples(using code snippets)\r\n- Demo of apps running on kotlin\r\n-The future of Kotlin(in mobile, web and machine learning)\r\n-Short Quiz\r\n-Q/A\r\n",
